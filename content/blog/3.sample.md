# Sample Markdown

This is some basic, sample markdown.

## Second Heading

* Unordered lists, and:

  1. One
  1. Two
  1. Three

* More

> Blockquote

And **bold**, *italics*, and even *italics and later **bold***. Even ~~strikethrough~~. [A link](https://markdowntohtml.com) to somewhere.

And code highlighting:

```js
const foo = 'bar'

function baz(s) {
  return `${foo}:${s}`
}
```

Or inline code like `var foo = 'bar';`.

Or an image of bears
