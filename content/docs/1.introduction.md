# Introduction

## Why NuxtPress?

I really love using [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) but if you want something built into [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) application that lies along with main codebase, uses Nuxt's awesome features like Nuxt SEO, don't have to deploy or maintain separately like blog & docs. Also, If you want to use [Nuxt Studio](https://nuxt.studio) then you can't use VitePress. Hence, I created this Nuxt Content theme that allows following:

- Utilizing existing Nuxt Features
- Write static content along with your main codebase
- Deploy main app, docs, blog, etc in one go
- Nuxt Studio Ready theme to edit content even in toilet without your laptop

> _UI is inspired from VitePress & [Anu](https://anu-vue.netlify.app/) (my deprecated Vue UI Lib)_

### But why name "NuxtPress"?

I always wanted comprehensive Nuxt Content theme that is compatible with Nuxt Studio and can be used for writing docs (For my SaaS projects) and blog (For my personal site).

As I made this as alternative to VitePress for nuxt, I named it NuxtPress.
